I've made a 3d-vector class vec(x,y,b)
here are some
u=100 200 300
v=1 2 3
vectors can also be cast to strings
u= 100 200 300

by operator overloading they may be added, multiplied etc.
u+v =101 202 303
w=3u-v=299 598 897

the class contains a method to take the dot-product
A=2 4 6
B=3 -6 9
A*B=36

likewise the cross-product
AxB=k=72 -54 -24
and Norm, |k| = 93.1450481775601

it is possible to compare two vectors
 v = u (False)
 u = u (True)
