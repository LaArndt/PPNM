Class implementation of the berrut spline 
Object stores original function aswell as spline allowing for easy differentaion and integration. Differantation and integration are computed using two-point numerics, 
higher order differentials are achieved by constructing a new object spline based on the derivatives. Runge effects do not remain supressed when taking higher order differentials

Results can be seen for the gaussian and step function in gauss.pdf and step.pdf respectively.
